# Hello

Iâ€™m Filip. I want to start writing more about the stuff I like. That is why I made this blog to host the things I write.
This web app is created using:

- NextJS
- TypeScript as the programming language
- Tailwind for all the styling
- Framer Motion for all of the animations
- MDX for embeding react components inside markdown

Blog files are stored locally inside /blog/ directory, then imported with getAllPosts.ts
And finally imported in the index page with getStaticProps.
