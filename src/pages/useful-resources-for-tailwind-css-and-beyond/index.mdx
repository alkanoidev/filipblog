## Icon Packs <a name="icon-packs"></a>

As UI developers we need to make sure our icons are consistent and recognizable to the users.
This means using the same iconography style throughout the application and avoiding mixing different icon sets that can confuse the user.

In addition to consistency, it's also important to ensure that the icons we use are clear and easily understandable.
An icon should convey its meaning quickly and effectively, without requiring the user to stop and think about what it represents.

To achieve this we can use all sorts of already made and free icon packs.

### [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) <a name="heroicons"></a>

Heroicons is a collection of around 300 SVG icons made by the creators of Tailwind that can be easily copied into your projects,
both as plain SVG and JSX-adjusted elements. It contains outlined, filled, and smaller versions of icons.

### [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) <a name="feather"></a>

Feather is an open-source icon pack that comes with a simple editor for adjusting size, color, and stroke width.
Each icon is designed on a 24x24 grid that can be customized to fit your needs.
